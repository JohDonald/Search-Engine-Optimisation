#Search Engine Optimisation

The goal of this challenge was to code an optimised search engine for recipes achieving bespoke results (/i.e. supporting the user's food preferences) with minimal wall time. A data set is provided. The search engine is to be pretty basic, returning all recipes that contain all of the provided keywords. However, the user can choose from a number of orderings depending on their food preferences, which the search engine should support.
